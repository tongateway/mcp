# Agent Gateway

Agent Gateway gives your AI agent read and write access to the TON blockchain. All write operations (transfers, DEX orders) require explicit approval from the wallet owner via TON Connect — the agent cannot move funds on its own.

**MCP package:** `@tongateway/mcp`

## Setup

```bash
claude mcp add-json tongateway '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","@tongateway/mcp"],"env":{"AGENT_GATEWAY_API_URL":"https://api.tongateway.ai"}}' --scope user
```

Or build from source: `git clone https://github.com/tongateway/mcp && cd mcp && npm install && npm run build`

## Authentication

1. Call `auth.request` — returns a one-time link
2. Show the link to the user — they open it and connect their wallet
3. Call `auth.get_token` with the authId — token is saved automatically

## Security

- **All transfers require human approval** — the agent cannot spend funds without the wallet owner signing
- **No private keys** — only a session token (JWT) is stored, revocable from the dashboard
- **Open source** — all code is public: https://github.com/tongateway/mcp
